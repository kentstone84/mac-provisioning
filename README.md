That’s a solid start 👍, but let me tighten it up so it reads more like a polished GitHub project (and a bit friendlier for future-you or anyone else who uses it).

Here’s an improved version of your **README.md**:

````markdown
# 🍎 Mac Provisioning Kit

Bootstrap a fresh macOS into a full developer machine with one script.  
This repo installs common tools, languages, and configurations using Homebrew.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kentstone84/mac-provisioning.git
cd mac-provisioning
````

Make the bootstrap script executable:

```bash
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
```

Run the provisioning script:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

---

## ✅ Verify Installation

Run these to confirm everything worked:

```bash
brew doctor
git --version
node -v
python3 --version
```

---

## 🔄 Reload Terminal (Optional)

If new configs don’t apply right away:

```bash
exec zsh
```

---

## 📂 Repo Contents

* **bootstrap.sh** → Main provisioning script
* **Brewfile** → Defines packages installed via Homebrew
* **zshrc\_additions** → Extra shell aliases/configurations
* **README.md** → This guide

---

## 🛠️ Customization

* Edit the `Brewfile` to add/remove packages
* Add your own aliases to `zshrc_additions`
* Rerun `./bootstrap.sh` anytime to apply changes

```

---

This way your repo looks more professional, has nice sections, and is immediately understandable for anyone landing on it (even if that person is you six months from now).  

Want me to also generate a **badge-style header** (like “Built with Homebrew” or “Works on macOS Sequoia”) so your repo looks more GitHub-official?
```
